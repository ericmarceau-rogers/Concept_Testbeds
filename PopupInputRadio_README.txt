This "test-rig" for a browser-based 2D game focuses on confirming the
constructs and logic for presenting a popup window prompting for user
selection of one from multiple (radio-button) choices.  There is no 
initial default selection or value.

Upon user clicking on one of the choices, that choice is highlighted
by modified CSS styling, the popup remaining visible for a shot time
so that the change can be "registered" by the user's senses then, after
the programmed delay period, triggers the closing of the popup.
