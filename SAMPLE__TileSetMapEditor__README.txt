This is a "reconstruction" of the "Tile Set Map Editor" that is published
on CodePen.io at

	https://codepen.io/punkydrewster713/pen/QWymBGy

Since it is not possible to make the application function using only the
contents of the three frames for editing HTML, CSS and JS, I chose to
analyze and "distill" the basic minimum required elements to achieve the
same functionality, with the same "sprite" start point, so that a
double-click on the html file stored on one's desktop will offer the full
App capability.

There have been a few "Appearance" and "layout" changes by me for what I
perceive to be more functional.  I have included a snapshot of both the 
original CodePen look, as well as one for my modified version, for your 
comparison, and review.

Users can then simply edit the various files to replace the "sprite" graphics
file with their own, and manually edit the canvas height and width sizes to
suit their own needs.

FUTURES:

I may incorporate, at a later date, some of the other JavaScript learnings
such that

	* the HTML page will present height and width numeric entry fields
	  for user-custom specification of those

	* add logic to auto-modify/upate height and width values for further
	  usage by the APP's JavaScript and the canvas size, to suit the user's needs.
