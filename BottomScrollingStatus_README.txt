This "test-rig" for a browser-based 2D game focuses on confirming the
constructs and logic for taking input strings and logging them in a
scrolling element, prefixing it with a 24-hour clock based timestamp
of when that "Command Input" was entered in real-time.

Limitations of the current "coding" are

 * position and size of the scrolling element have been manually
   tweaked, instead of auto-ajusting to fit correctly within the 
   confines of, and at the bottom of, Box D.

 * "input" element attributes are not fully specified.  Would
   like to eliminate the bordering hightlight which is displayed
   upon cursor clicking into the box for input.

 * "input" element is not the auto-focused element.  Would 
   like the cursor to be auto-placed into that element for user
   input at initial loading of the page into the browser.
